1. Categorize each track based on its duration into three categories: 'Short', 'Medium', and 'Long'. This classification should be based on the track's duration (in the "Milliseconds" column) as per the following criteria:

  -Short: 0 - 120,000 milliseconds (0 - 2 minutes)
  -Medium: 120,001 - 300,000 milliseconds (2 - 5 minutes)
  -Long: Above 300,000 milliseconds (5 minutes and above)

Produce a result set with two columns:
  -"Name": The name of the track
  -"LengthCategory": The category ('Short', 'Medium', 'Long') the track belongs to based on its duration
  -Sort your results first by "LengthCategory", and then by "Name"
